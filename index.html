            <h2>Listen Up...</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Melody Hads. I'm 26 and currently living in the beautifyl NW with my amazing husband, 2 incredible babies and 1 sassy little fur baby! I have a crazy diverse array of hobbies. One of them is web development. 
              I am currently enrolled at Lambda School. I'm working my way through the web development program. I love learning new 
              ways to make things happen. Watching something come from nothing is a huge satisfaction to me. Knowing that it is turning out exactly
              as expected is even better. I have linked my portfolio at the top of this page. Feel free to check out some of my work and then get ahold of me. I would love
              to hear from you!
